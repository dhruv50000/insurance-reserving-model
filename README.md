# Insurance Reserving Model (Self-Initiated)

This project simulates the development of a simplified loss reserving model using synthetic claim triangle data. It applies traditional actuarial techniques such as Chain-Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson (B-F) methods to estimate incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Construct synthetic claim development triangles for cumulative incurred losses
- Estimate outstanding reserves using Chain-Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods
- Calculate loss development factors (LDFs) and link ratios
- Conduct scenario testing and sensitivity analysis to assess reserve adequacy

- **Cumulative vs. Incremental Triangle Conversion**  
- **Chain-Ladder Reserve Estimation**  
- **Bornhuetter-Ferguson (B-F) Method**  
- **Reserve Adequacy Testing & Tail Development**

## 📊 Features

- 📈 Full development triangle with 10 origin years and 10 development periods  
- 🧮 Average, volume-weighted, and age-to-age link ratios computed  
- 💼 Comparison of Chain-Ladder vs. B-F estimates under different assumptions  
- 🔁 Scenario testing using inflation-adjusted loss ratios and tail assumptions
